### Data Format and Structure
The dataset is provided in MAT (MATLAB) file format, containing vibration signals sampled at a specific frequency over the monitoring period.
Each MAT file corresponds to a specific time interval, capturing vibration data from the high-speed shaft during that period.

### Data Content
The primary data in each MAT file consists of vibration signals recorded from sensors installed on the wind turbine's high-speed shaft.
The vibration signals represent mechanical vibrations generated by the turbine's operation, which can indicate the health condition of the bearings.
Each signal is likely represented as a time-series dataset, with timestamps indicating the time of measurement and corresponding vibration amplitudes.

### Metadata Description
The dataset lacks specific metadata standards, necessitating comprehensive documentation to explain all details.
Metadata provided includes information about the wind turbine's specifications, such as its capacity (2MW), operational parameters, and bearing characteristics.
Additionally, the dataset may include details about the monitoring setup, such as sensor placement, sampling frequency, and data acquisition system used.
Domain-specific metadata may encompass details about the inner race fault detection methodology, signal processing techniques applied, and any preprocessing steps performed on the raw vibration data.

### Data Repository Deposit
The dataset is deposited in a data repository, hosted on the MathWorks website, ensuring accessibility and preservation.
The repository provides rich descriptions of the dataset's content, objectives, and usage instructions, enhancing its usability for researchers and practitioners.
Extensive metadata accompanying the dataset includes details about its origin, collection methodology, and intended applications, facilitating cross-references and interoperability with related datasets.

### Units and Labels
Units for vibration signals may include amplitude (e.g., acceleration in m/s^2), frequency (e.g., Hz), and time (e.g., seconds).
Labels indicating the health condition of the bearings (e.g., normal operation, impending failure) may be included, derived from domain-specific analysis methods or expert annotations.


## S2 - Wind Turbine Scada Dataset

This dataset, available on Kaggle, focuses specifically on wind
turbine failures. It includes information on the type of failure, time of occurrence, turbine
specifications, and environmental conditions leading up to the failure events.
