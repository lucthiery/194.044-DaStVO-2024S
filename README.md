# Project: Predictive Maintenance for Wind Turbines

This experiment aims to develop a predictive maintenance model for wind turbines using machine
learning techniques. Wind turbines are crucial for renewable energy generation, but unexpected
failures can lead to significant downtime and maintenance costs. The input to the experiment
includes historical data on wind turbine operations, environmental conditions, maintenance logs,
and failure events. The goal is to predict potential failures in wind turbines before they occur,
enabling proactive maintenance scheduling and optimization of maintenance resources. H0 can a
model be built to predict failure, H1 no model can be build.

## Data Sources

S1. Wind Turbine High-Speed Bearing Prognosis: The dataset tracks vibration signals from a 2MW
wind turbine's high-speed shaft to monitor the development of an inner race fault leading to
bearing failure over 50 consecutive days.

S2. Wind Turbine Scada Dataset: This dataset, available on Kaggle, focuses specifically on wind
turbine failures. It includes information on the type of failure, time of occurrence, turbine
specifications, and environmental conditions leading up to the failure events.

S3. NREL Wind Turbine Dataset: This dataset, provided by the National Renewable Energy
Laboratory (NREL), includes operational data from various wind turbines, such as wind
speed, turbine rotational speed, power output, and environmental conditions. It also contains
information on maintenance activities and failure events
